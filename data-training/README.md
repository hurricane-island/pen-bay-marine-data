# Welcome to Python Data Quality Assurance Training!

First, we will follow some examples within this repository to get everyone up to speed on numerical Python. Then we will work on data visualization with Hurricane Island data.

Feel free to refer back to this repository whenever you need!

Look around and you'll find:
- `README.md`: This document, written in Markdown
- `pixi.toml`: controls Python environment and dependencies using Pixi
- `examples.py`: functions that implement helpful transformations and I/O operations
- `tutorial.py`: the source code to work from during activities.
- `data/`: directory contains data to work with

To get started:
- Clone the repository locally
- Create a new branch from the command line using `git checkout -b <BRANCHNAME>`
- Install Python dependencies with `pixi install`
- Run `pixi run python examples.py` to create the cleaned data to work with
- Work through `tutorial.py` by modifying or uncommenting sections to see how things work
- Look at `examples.py` for reference implementations of common operations
